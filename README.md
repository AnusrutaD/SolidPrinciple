# SOLID Principle

## Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have only one reason to change

## Open Close Principle

Open for extension but close for modification

## Liskov Substitution Principle

if class B is a subtype of class A, than we should replace object of A with B without breaking the behaviour of the program

subclass should extend the capability of parent class not narrow it down

## Interface Segregation Principle

Interface should be such, that client should implement unnecessary function they do not need 

## Dependency Inversion Principle

Class should depends on interfaces rather than concrete classes
